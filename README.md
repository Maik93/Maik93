### Hi there 🔭

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Perceptual Robotics 🤖, I focus my research on high-level controls for autonomous vehicles, both terrestrials 🏎️ and aerials 🛸, but I also enjoy Embedded programming and low-level controls!

I's with great sorrow that I cannot share most of my Ph.D.-related code with the entire world, but if you've reached my Github from some of my research works, please feel free to take contact with me.

You can find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-mugnai-a33347185/)!
